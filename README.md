# QUACKPACKS #
==============
- Quackpacks is a silly idea I had to create a "Loot" - NFT derivative for the Crypto Duckies project.
- Quackpacks is randomized Duckie RPG gear generated and stored on chain. 
- Stats, images, and other functionality are intentionally omitted for others to interpret. Feel free to use Quackpacks in any way you want.
- Each Quackpack is filled with a random assortment of differnt Items and Gear for each of your Duckies.
- Only 5000 Quackpacks can be minted and will require a unique Duckie ID to begin the minting process. Once a duckie's ID has been used to mint a Quackpack, its ID will no
    longer be a valid input to begin the minting process. Ensuring that each 1 duck is tied to 1 Quackpack.



// The Items & Gear in each Quackpack are listed in the following order:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

  1. Held Hand Item
  2. Chest Gear
  3. Head Gear
  4. Leg Gear
  5. Feet Gear
  6. Arm Gear
  7. Support Item
  8. Backpack Item
  
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  - 1/25 Chance to have an Item/Gear be given a Greatness Level of +1
  - 1/5 Chance to have an Item/Gear be given a Prefix and/or Suffix
